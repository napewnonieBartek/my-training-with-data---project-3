In this project, I focused on cleaning and merging data from two tables to prepare a comprehensive dataset for analysis. The aim was to explore interesting insights related to average IQ levels in various parts of the world. Using PostgreSQL, I applied data transformation techniques, handled missing values, and performed necessary joins between the tables. The resulting dataset enabled me to visualize global trends and uncover relationships between IQ and other socio-economic factors.
